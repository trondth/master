# Syntax for fine-grained opinion analysis

Fine-grained opinion analysis is one task in the field of sentiment
analysis/opinion mining. This involves, among other things, detecting
opinionated subparts of a text and linking targets of opinion and
opinion holders together. As a part of the master's thesis, we present
an environment for experimentation with the MPQA Opinion Corpus and a
variety of linguistic analysis tools and target representations. We
will use this to investigate quantitative and qualitative effects when
using different types of interface representations to syntactic
analysis.

On this project github site, we provide the source code that we developed for the project. In the following, we will give an description of the installation and the usage of these tools.

(The information on this page will be expanded)

# Installation

After cloning the repository, a config file should be created, overriding the information in the default settings file, `masters_project-default.cfg`.

We provide in the folder `preprocessed_files` the preprocessed files for error analysis and experimenting with features. In the section [quick run](#quickrun) below, we will describe how to do this.

To run the full system, a number of tools need to install:

- Repp
- Resa
- Stanford POS tagger
- MPQA Opinion Corpus
- [Subjectivity Lexicon](http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/lexicons/subj_lexicon/) (Wilson, Wiebe, and Hoffmann)
- LTH SRL parser
- Bohnet & Nivre parser
- Liblinear
- Wapiti
